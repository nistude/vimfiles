# This is my vim setup.
#
# I'm using pathogen to keep all my vim plugins in separate directories,
# and git submodules to manage both pathogen itself and all the plugins.
#
# To get started, just move your existing .vim and .vimrc out of the way and
# source this file, or type the following from wherever you want to install:

git clone --recursive git://github.com/nistude/vimfiles.git
ln -s $PWD/vim ~/.vim
ln -s $PWD/vimrc ~/.vimrc
